==========

DigiWeight software aims at managing a digital weighing device through
a touch panel computer. It is written in Python and makes use of the
`Kivy`_ framework.

DigiWeight allows the user to weigh things and print summary
labels. The label will display the date, the weight and the item
category, which can be chosen from a list on the touch panel.
